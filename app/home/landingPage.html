      <p>....There once was a woman called mary jane born April 20th.br/>
	   Just by being with her you were committing a crime, but she was irresistable. <br/>
	  She was such an attraction that both men and women messed with her.<br/>
	  She made you feel good and could put your ass to sleep.<br/>
	  A kiss from her was rumoured to give black lips and turn eyes red. <br/>
	  They said she's high grade, she loud. <br/>
	  The strongest argument for her legality was very simple,<br/>
	  "How can a government outlaw a person God created"<br/><br/>
